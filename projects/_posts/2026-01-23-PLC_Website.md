The current PLC website gets the job done but it absolutely can be improved. I'm currently working on updating the website with some minor tweaks and adding some features that will automate a lot of redundancy for PLC workers. I've already implemented a feature that automatically adds a demo to our demo delivery google calander when a professor orders it and I am now making user interface adjustments that will give professors more options when ordering a demonstration. The flow chart below shows what the final ideal flow of the website will look like.

The next big step is to update our SQL database with our labratory inventory and non demo materials.
