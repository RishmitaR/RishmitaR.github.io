The [TAMU Physics Lab Center](https://plc.tamu.edu/) is responsible for setting up labs used in the physics ciriculum, building physics demonstrations, and for delivering physics demonstrations to physics professors. I'm currently working on updating the website with some minor tweaks and adding some features that will automate a lot of redundancy for PLC workers. I've already implemented a feature that automatically adds a demo to our demo delivery google calander when a professor orders said demo and I am now making user interface adjustments that will give professors more options when ordering a demonstration. The flow chart below shows what the final ideal flow of the website will look like.

The next big step is to update our SQL database with our labratory inventory and non demo materials.
