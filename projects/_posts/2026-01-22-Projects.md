This is the page where I will go into a lot more depth about my projects! The ability to properly document a code base is an underrated skill, so having a projects page where I can easily reference code I've written and algorithms/code structures that I now know work will be incredibly useful as I continue to code new projects and refactorize and fix deployed projects.
