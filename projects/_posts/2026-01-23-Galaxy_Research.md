Click <a href="https://aas242-aas.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=36-86-58-BA-A9-45-8B-40-6D-7D-1E-BC-A9-F0-0A-1B" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> here</a> for the link to the IPoster that explains my undergraduate research! I presented this at the 245th American Astronomical Society conference in January, 2025. In the future I'm going to directly recreate the Iposter on this page so I can cohesively highlight my work in one location and keep the visuals themed to my portfolio.
